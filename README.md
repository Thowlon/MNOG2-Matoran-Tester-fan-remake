# MNOG2 Matoran Tester fan remake

## THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL FAN REMAKE STILL WIP

I plan to pause this project for now. I was planning on recreating and improving the original MNOG2 published by the LEGO Group and created by Templar Studios, but because of time issues and not enough experience with flash and getting the needed resources, I decided to pause it and first create something on my own.

This was a try to create the character logic of movement and interactions with the already existing Matoran Tester.

If anyone of you wants to give it a try improving it, feel free to try it. I have big troubles implementing the animations.
